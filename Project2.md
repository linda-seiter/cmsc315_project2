# CMSC 315 Project #2: Word Frequency & Sentiment Analysis Program

In this project, youâ€™ll implement a set of basic **Natural Language Processing**
(NLP) utility methods to analyze a paragraph of text entered by the user.

---

### Starter Code Info

Download project2_starter.zip and extract the files. The zip contains two
classes, `Main.java` and `NLPUtility.java`. You should be able to create a new
Java project and copy the two classes into your project.

The `Main` class is fully implemented and takes care of user input. It calls the
methods youâ€™ll implement in the `NLPUtility` class.

Predefined sets available in the `main` method:

- `stopWords`: A set of common words to exclude from frequency analysis.
- `positiveWords`: A set of positive sentiment words.
- `negativeWords`: A set of negative sentiment words.

You **should not change** any of the predefined sets. Instead, your task is to
**complete all the static methods in `NLPUtility`** by replacing the current
placeholder return statements (such as `return null`) with working code based on
the method descriptions.

---

## Tasks: Implement the following methods in the `NLPUtility` class

---

### Task 1. `public static String[] splitTextIntoTokens(String text)`

**Splits the text it into individual words, treating consecutive whitespace or
punctuation characters as a single delimiter.**

NOTE: The regular expression given in the Pearson textbook in section 21.6 is
incorrect. The plus sign should follow the character class to match 1 or more
white space or punctuation characters.

`text.split("[\\s\\p{P}]+")`

#### Example:

```java
String[] tokens = NLPUtility.splitTextIntoTokens("WOW!?!    That .?#       is  REALLY(reaLLy)  amazing!    ");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(tokens));
// [WOW, That, is, REALLY, reaLLy, amazing]
```

---

### Task 2. `public static TreeMap<String, Integer> countFilteredWords(String[] words, Set<String> stopWords)`

**Counts the frequency of non-stop words in the given array of words, ignoring
case. Returns a `TreeMap` sorted alphabetically by key (i.e. word).**

#### Example:

```java
String[] words = {"i", "love", "a", "good", "BOOK", "and", "LOVE", "sad", "BooK", "book"};
Set<String> stopWords = new HashSet<>(
   Arrays.asList("the", "is", "in", "at", "of", "and", "a", "to", "it", "or", "was", "so"));

System.out.println(NLPUtility.countFilteredWords(words, stopWords));
//{book=3, good=1, i=1, love=2, sad=1}
```

---

### Task 3. `public static LinkedHashMap<String, Integer> sortByValueDescending(Map<String, Integer> map)`

**Returns a `LinkedHashMap` sorted by frequency in descending order. For ties,
maintains the original order of keys as they appear in the map.**

Algorithm:

1. Convert the word map entries to a list for sorting
2. Sort the list of entries in descending order based on value (frequency)
3. Create a LinkedHashMap and insert the sorted entries to maintain their order.

#### Example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> wordMap = new TreeMap<>();
wordMap.put("book", 3);
wordMap.put("good", 1);
wordMap.put("i", 1);
wordMap.put("love", 2);
wordMap.put("sad", 1);

System.out.println(wordMap); // {book=3, good=1, i=1, love=2, sad=1}

System.out.println(NLPUtility.sortByValueDescending(wordMap)); // {book=3, love=2, good=1, i=1, sad=1}
```

---

### Task 4. `public static String getSentimentFromFrequencies(Map<String, Integer> wordMap, Set<String> positiveWords, Set<String> negativeWords)`

**Sums the total frequencies of words in the corresponding positive and negative
word sets. Returns a summary string in the format "Positive: X, Negative: Y".**

#### Example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> wordMap2 = new LinkedHashMap<>();
wordMap2.put("book", 3);
wordMap2.put("love", 2); // positive
wordMap2.put("good", 1); // positive
wordMap2.put("i", 1);
wordMap2.put("sad", 1); // negative
System.out.println(wordMap2); // {book=3, love=2, good=1, i=1, sad=1}

Set<String> positiveWords = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("good", "great", "happy", "love", "like"));
Set<String> negativeWords = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("bad", "terrible", "horrible", "sad", "hate"));

System.out.println(NLPUtility.getSentiment(wordMap2, positiveWords, negativeWords));// Positive: 3, Negative: 1
```

---

### Task 5. `public static Map<String, Object> getWordsWithMaxFrequency(Map<String, Integer> wordMap)`

**Returns a map containing an alphabetically sorted list of words that appear
most frequently in the given word map, along with the corresponding frequency.**

Algorithm:

- Finds the maximum frequency value in the input map
- Collect a list of all words that occur with that frequency
- Sorts the list alphabetically
- Returns a new map with two entries having the following keys:
  - "words": a list of most frequent words, sorted alphabetically
  - "frequency": the maximum frequency as an integer

**Note:** The returned map contains two entries with `String` keys: `"words"`
and `"frequency"`.

- The value associated with `"words"` is a `List<String>` containing the most
  frequently occurring words.
- The value for `"frequency"` is an `Integer` representing the highest frequency
  found.

Because the values are of different types (`List<String>` and `Integer`), the
method returns a map of type `Map<String, Object>`.

#### Example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> wordMap3 = new LinkedHashMap<>();
wordMap3.put("good", 1);
wordMap3.put("i", 1);
wordMap3.put("love", 3);
wordMap3.put("book", 3);
wordMap3.put("sad", 1);
System.out.println(wordMap3); // {good=1, i=1, love=3, book=3, sad=1}

System.out.println(NLPUtility.getWordsWithMaxFrequency(wordMap3)); // {words=[book, love], frequency=3}

```

Note that the map passed as a parameter may not be sorted by frequency or word.
Your method will have to find the maximum frequency, along with all words that
are mapped to that frequency.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Program Flow

```text
Enter a paragraph of text:
I really love a good book, and You REALLY love a sad movie.  We both ReAllY LOVE going for a walk!

Tokenized:
[I, really, love, a, good, book, and, You, REALLY, love, a, sad, movie, We, both, ReAllY, LOVE, going, for, a, walk]

Word map sorted by key ascending:
book:1
both:1
for:1
going:1
good:1
i:1
love:3
movie:1
really:3
sad:1
walk:1
we:1
you:1

Word map sorted by value descending:
love:3
really:3
book:1
both:1
for:1
going:1
good:1
i:1
movie:1
sad:1
walk:1
we:1
you:1

Sentiment: Positive: 4, Negative: 1

Most frequent word(s): [love, really] (used 3 times)
```

---

## ðŸš« Example: Empty or Non-Meaningful Input

```text
Enter a paragraph of text:
SO is.!  It????

Tokenized:
[SO, is, It]

No valid words found.
```

## Submitting your solution

You are to submit two files.

1. The first is a `.zip` file that contains all the source code for the project.
   The `.zip` file should contain only source code and nothing else, which means
   only the `.java` files. If you elect to use a package the `.java` files
   should be in a folder whose name is the package name. Every outer class
   should be in a separate `.java` file with the same name as the class name.
   Each file should include a comment block at the top containing your name, the
   project name, the date, and a short description of the class contained in
   that file.

2. The second is a Word document (PDF or RTF is also acceptable) that contains
   the documentation for the project, which should include the following:
   - A UML class diagram that includes all classes.
   - A test plan that includes test cases that you have created indicating what
     aspects of the program each one is testing.
     - Conduct unit tests for each method within the `NLPUtility` class. You may
       want to develop separate test classes (include "Test" in the class name,
       and/or place in a separate package) to individually call each method in
       isolation. Include screenshots that capture the result of your unit
       tests. Ensure your test cases sufficiently demonstrate each method
       returns a sorted result when sorting is required.
   - A short paragraph on lessons learned from the project.
