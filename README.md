# üß† CMSC 315 Project #2: Word Frequency & Sentiment Analysis Program

In this project, you‚Äôll implement a set of basic **Natural Language Processing**
(NLP) utility methods to analyze a paragraph of text entered by the user.

---

### üß± Starter Code Info

The `Main` class is already provided and takes care of user input. It calls the
methods you‚Äôll implement in the `NLPUtility` class. You **should not change**
any of the predefined constants. Instead, your task is to **complete all the
static methods in `NLPUtility`** by replacing the current placeholder return statements
(such as `return null`) with working code based on the method descriptions.

Predefined constants available to you:

- `STOP_WORDS`: A set of common words to exclude from frequency analysis.
- `POSITIVE_WORDS`: A set of positive sentiment words.
- `NEGATIVE_WORDS`: A set of negative sentiment words.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks: Implement the following methods in the `NLPUtility` class

---

### 1. `public static String[] getWordTokens(String text)`

**Splits the text it into individual words, treating consecutive whitespace or punctuation characters as a
single delimiter.**

NOTE: The regular expression given in the Pearson textbook in section 21.6 is incorrect.
The plus sign should follow the character class to match 1 or more white space or punctuation characters.

`text.split("[\\s\\p{P}]+")`

#### Example:

```java
NLPUtility.getWordTokens("WOW!?!    That .?#       is  REALLY(reaLLy)  amazing!    ");
// returns: [WOW, That, is, REALLY, reaLLy, amazing]
```

---

### 2. `public static TreeMap<String, Integer> getNonStopWordFrequencies(String[] words)`

**Counts the frequency of non-stop words in the given array of words, ignoring case.
Returns a `TreeMap` sorted alphabetically by key (i.e. word).**

#### Example:

```java
String[] words = {"i", "love", "a", "good", "BOOK", "and", "LOVE", "sad", "BooK", "book"};
NLPUtility.getNonStopWordFrequencies(words);
// returns: {book=3, good=1, i=1, love=2, sad=1} ‚Äî the map excludes stop-words "a", "and"
```

---

### 3. `public static LinkedHashMap<String, Integer> getMapSortedByValueDesc(Map<String, Integer> wordMap)`

**Returns a `LinkedHashMap` sorted by frequency in descending order. For ties,
maintains the original order of keys as they appear in the map.**

Algorithm:
1. Convert the word map entries to a list for sorting
2. Sort the list of entries in descending order based on frequency (value)
3. Create a LinkedHashMap and insert the sorted entries to maintain their order.

#### Example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> wordMap = new TreeMap<>();
wordMap.put("book", 3);
wordMap.put("good", 1);
wordMap.put("i", 1);
wordMap.put("love", 2);
wordMap.put("sad", 1);  //{book=3, good=1, i=1, love=2, sad=1}

NLPUtility.getMapSortedByValueDesc(wordMap);
//returns: {book=3, love=2, good=1, i=1, sad=1}
```

---

### 4. `public static String getSentimentFromFrequencies(Map<String, Integer> wordMap)`

**Adds up frequencies of words in `POSITIVE_WORDS` and `NEGATIVE_WORDS`. Returns
a summary string in the format "Positive: X, Negative: Y".**

#### Example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> wordMap2 = new LinkedHashMap<>();
wordMap2.put("book", 3);
wordMap2.put("good", 1); //positive
wordMap2.put("i", 1);
wordMap2.put("love", 2); //positive
wordMap2.put("sad", 1);  //negative

NLPUtility.getSentimentFromFrequencies(wordMap2);
// returns: "Positive: 3, Negative: 1"
```

---

### 5. `public static List<String> getMostFrequentWords(Map<String, Integer> wordMap)`

**Returns an alphabetically sorted list of word(s) having the highest frequency in the map.**

#### Example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> wordMap3 = new LinkedHashMap<>();
wordMap3.put("book", 3);
wordMap3.put("love", 3);
wordMap3.put("good", 1);
wordMap3.put("i", 1);
wordMap3.put("sad", 1);  //{book=3, love=3, good=1, i=1, sad=1}

NLPUtility.getMostFrequentWords(wordMap3);
// returns  ["book", "love"]
```

## üß™ Sample Program Flow

```text
Enter a paragraph of text:
I really love a good book, and You REALLY love a sad movie.  We both ReAllY LOVE going for a walk!

Tokenized:
[I, really, love, a, good, book, and, You, REALLY, love, a, sad, movie, We, both, ReAllY, LOVE, going, for, a, walk]

Word map sorted by key ascending:
book:1
both:1
for:1
going:1
good:1
i:1
love:3
movie:1
really:3
sad:1
walk:1
we:1
you:1

Word map sorted by value descending:
love:3
really:3
book:1
both:1
for:1
going:1
good:1
i:1
movie:1
sad:1
walk:1
we:1
you:1

Sentiment: Positive: 4, Negative: 1

Most frequent word(s): [love, really] (used 3 times)
```

---

## üö´ Example: Empty or Non-Meaningful Input

```text
Enter a paragraph of text:
SO is.!  It????

Tokenized:
[SO, is, It]

No valid words found.
```

## Submitting your solution

You are to submit two files.

1. The first is a `.zip` file that contains all the source code for the project.
   The `.zip` file should contain only source code and nothing else, which means
   only the `.java` files. If you elect to use a package the `.java` files
   should be in a folder whose name is the package name. Every outer class
   should be in a separate `.java` file with the same name as the class name.
   Each file should include a comment block at the top containing your name, the
   project name, the date, and a short description of the class contained in
   that file.

2. The second is a Word document (PDF or RTF is also acceptable) that contains
   the documentation for the project, which should include the following:
   - A UML class diagram that includes all classes.
   - A test plan that includes test cases that you have created indicating what
     aspects of the program each one is testing.
     - Conduct unit tests for each method within the `NLPUtility` class. You may
       want to develop separate test classes (include "Test" in the class name,
       and/or place in a separate package) to individually call each method in
       isolation. Include screenshots that capture the result of your unit
       tests.
   - A short paragraph on lessons learned from the project.
